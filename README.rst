SolrInspector
======

SorlInspector is a purposfully small library to inspect fields and facets.
For a given SOLR_URL you will be able to view and interact with all fields that are currently indexed in your Solr Instance.

Given a field name, you will be able to view and itneract with all facets for that field.

This builds upon the great work of mysolr[1].
